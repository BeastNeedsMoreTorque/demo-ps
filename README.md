A contrived purerl example
==

- This app is written in Purescript on the frontend, and Purescript on the backend (using Purerl + Stetson + Pinto)
- This app demonstrates basic CRUD 
- This app demonstrates an extremely basic UI using view models from the backend
- This app demonstrates a contrived use of a gen server
- This app demonstrates some very basic interop with Erlang on the backend

That is it, it isn't best practises and it isn't at all useful - but it's a good template for new apps that actually do something real.

Running the example
==

``` bash

rebar3 compile
./run

```

Open a browser to http://localhost:3000, enjoy the contrived example
